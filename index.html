    <p>Chef John's baked ziti recipe is easy enough to manage on a school night, but this meal feels special enough for a Sunday dinner. The mixture of sweet and spicy sausage gives this baked pasta an extra boost of flavor.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>¾ pound hot Italian sausage</li>
        <li>¾ pound sweet Italian sausage</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons olive oil</li>
        <li>1 large yellow onion, diced</li>
        <li>½ teaspoon dried oregano</li>
        <li>¼ teaspoon dried thyme</li>
        <li>¼ teaspoon dried rosemary</li>
        <li>2 (24 ounce) jars prepared marinara sauce</li>
        <li>2 cups water</li>
    </ul>
    <ol>
    <li>Cut down the length of each sausage with a sharp knife. Remove and discard casings.</li>
    <li>Heat olive oil in a large saucepan set over high heat. Add sausages and onion. Cook, stirring occasionally and breaking up with a spatula, until sausage begins to brown, and onion turns translucent, 5 to 7 minutes. Add oregano, thyme, and rosemary and cook for 1 minute more. Pour in marinara sauce. Pour 1 cup water into each jar to rinse out remaining sauce; add to the saucepan. Stir together and bring sauce to a simmer.</li>
    <li>Reduce the heat to medium-low, and let simmer, stirring occasionally, for 1 hour. Taste for seasoning and adjust if needed. Turn off heat and reserve until needed. Before using, skim any excess fat that rises to the surface.
    </li>
    <li>While sauce simmers, bring a large pot of generously salted water to a boil. Add ziti and cook, stirring occasionally, for 1 or 2 minutes less than the directions on the package call for, about 8 minutes. Drain well and transfer into a large mixing bowl.</li>
    </ol>
