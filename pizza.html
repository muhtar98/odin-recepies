    <p>Pizza Margherita (pronounced mahr-geh-ree-tah) is basically a Neapolitan pizza, typically made with tomatoes, mozzarella cheese, garlic, fresh basil, and extra-virgin olive oil. I think of it as a sophisticated version of your basic cheese pizza and also a wonderful Caprese salad, but with a crust.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>tomatoes</li>
        <li>Fresh Mozzarela</li>
        <li>Fresh Basil</li>
        <li>Extra-Virgin oil</li>
        <li>Garlic</li>
    </ul>
    <ol>
        <li>Place a pizza stone in the oven. Preheat the oven to 500 degrees F, allowing the stone to get hot.</li>
        <li>Shape the pizza dough on a floured surface into an 8-inch round, making it 1/4-inch thick. Transfer it to a pizza peel lined with parchment paper. Reshape if necessary.</li>
        <li>Gently brush the dough with the olive oil, then evenly spread the marinara sauce on, leaving a 1-inch border around the edge. Sprinkle the garlic over the top. Top with the mozzarella slices and tomatoes, leaving space in between.</li>
        <li>Slide the parchment with the crust onto the heated stone. Bake for 8-10 minutes until crust is golden and cheese is melted and bubbly.</li>
        <li>Remove from oven and sprinkle the basil over the top, along with 1-2 grinds of fresh black pepper.</li>
        <li>Cut into wedges and serve immediately.</li>
    </ol>
